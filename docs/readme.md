# What is TSAR?
TSAR is a productivity tool that aims to be a digital "extension of your mind" for interacting with more data than you can remember, such as a personal knowledge base (pkb), digital journal, or collection of notes.  It is a flexible, extensible, terminal interface for managing your digital documents *with maxmimal efficiency*.

# Features
- **Access**: Search as you type with fuzzy matching, wildcards, filters, and more.  Browse documents by similarity and use keyword tags.
- **Workflow Integration**: TSAR integrates with your workflow: use your favorite web browser, editor, etc. when interacting directly with documents.
- **Extensibility**: The real power of TSAR lies in *Record Types*.  Use the included record types to define how TSAR handles your documents, or write your own with the library of functions.
- **Flexibility**: Customize key bindings, default screens, syntax highlighting for each collection.
- **Study Tools**: Absorb information from your documents with spaced-repetition review.
