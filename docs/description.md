# WHAT IS TSAR, WHY SHOULD I CARE?
TSAR provides a frictionless interface for interacting with large data sets.  From introspection tools (search, browse, keyword association) to curation and learning tools (raw data capture, spaced-repitition review, annotation), tsar modalities are designed to mirror cognitive tasks for data interaction. TSAR augments your ability to *think* with large digital docuement collections and facilitate learning from them.

# INTERACTION MODALITIES
- capture: "digital paper", thought formulation; frictionless "scratch pad" which documents can gneerated on the fly
- search: interactive, with filters and keywords; used for rapid discovery or "fuzzy" lookup
- browse: retrieve semantically similar documents
- inspect: browse catelogues of documents _not_ in a collection, with possiblity to add them.
- collection summarization: provide information to understand macroscopic features of a collection
- review: spaced repetition, reminders, etc.; pushes data from docs to your brain
- reflection^\*: guided interaction/"conversation" mode used to revisit ideas, reflect on docs, etc. Concept incomplete.

# USE CASES/EXAMPLES
- **Personal Knowledge Repository**: Catelog and curate knowledge accrued over the years; browse, search and add to it instantly.
- **Journal/Task manager**: add transient notes with no overhead (capture); memorialize relevant info later in a new .md or addition to existing .md.
- **Study Aid**: Internalize information from class notes or interview prep material with annotation and spaced repetition review tools.
- **Data Discovery**: use an exiting template or write your own record definition to parse a collection of documents and interact with using the TSAR interface.  For example, a Arxiv parser lets you live-search recent publications, browse, or take notes.
- **Data comprehension**: automated document browsing and summarization tools help make sense of large corpuses of unexplored documents.  Whether document review for law, perusing papers on Arxiv or job listings on linkedIn, TSAR can help make sense of the records landscape.

# ADDITIONAL FEATURES
- TSAR is a doc type *extensible* interface; use existing templates or create your own definition for converting .md, .txt, .pdf, or image documents into records.
- TSAR leverages your preferred tools: choose the editor/browser/etc of choice for document viewing/editing.
- performant: runs in the background and is always ready to respond quickly
- Terminal-based: closer to terminal-based workstream, lightweight, cross platform, and cross ssh!

# What are similar tools and how is TSAR distinct?
- **org mode**: (unknown)
- **Roam**: (unknown)
- **nvALT**: Tsar is doc-type agnostic, terminal interface (ssh?) and curation tools
- **Google/Chrome bookmarks**: Tsar can be used locally, with curation tools for your collections
- **Simple Note/Notes (mac)/...**: (unknown)
- **confluence/wiki.js**: Tsar has (faster) terminal access, is doc-type extensible, adds curation tools.

- vs local files + grep: a "poor man's" TSAR.  TSAR should simply be more usable and have additional features.
- vs Evernote: TSAR is extensible, terminal based, and faster(?)
- emacs org-mode: TSAR is editor independent, with greater focus on data curation and introspection than task management.

# RENAME
Textual Search And Retrieve no longer really fits.  What to rename it?
- cognilink, datalink, infolink, neuralink, cognex,
- metathought, metathink,
- dataport,
- logex (word-extension)
- recollect(ion), introspect
