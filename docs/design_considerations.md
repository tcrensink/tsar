# Key considerations
- What is the *fastest* interface from thought to example?  Google/Stack Overflow set par here.
- What is the *fastest/easiest* method for capture/adding new data?  If it takes too much time to add an example while you work, it's useless.  Maybe two tier system (add information, refine information?)
- What is the *fastest* way to organize for later retrieval? Compare with wiki/manually generated relational graph... too slow!

# Data retrieval
- **search**: fuzzy search of multiple fields, set operations, maybe a "smart ranking" system
- **tagging**: labels for filtering relevance, live update

# Storage/organization ideas
- **database with fields**: name, date (timestamp index?), description, tags.
- **metadata**: access, edit, search histories

- **spatial storage representation**
	- 3D spatial location is strongly associated with memory; top method used by memorization masters.
	- 3 dimensions is incapable of representing the multifold connection between concepts and ideas, so it may only be loosely relational, or at least not static

- **temporal storage representation**
	- every recorded/tagged (stored) by date (for example, the wiki).
	- naturally unique; there is only one time/day associated with a page you create...
